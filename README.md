# A little bit of background
i-DAT, based in Plymouth University, investigates the digital practice of exploring data. When gone through processing, it could evolve to play in contemporary culture. While being collaborative, it aims to engage audiences and communities who have an interest in the arts and sciences. There Have been many digital projects made over the last 20 years that i-DAT have been present. These have contributed to many strategic public, non-profit, private and community sectors; including Arts Council England, museums, festivals, councils etc.
