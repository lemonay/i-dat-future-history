# Noogy

Talk to "noogy" by texting a question to a mobile phone number occoured in 2006 who was also part of the Motion Plymouth Destival during that year too. Displayed on Portand Square, many people who saw it had different opions, some saying that Noogy was in the building while others said that it looked like a virral infection, like a bad cold that couldn't be shaken.
